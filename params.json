{"name":"Chuck joke","tagline":"A clone of github.com/joningis/hugb_hello_world for continuing work.","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thorgerdur/chuck_joke.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/thorgerdur/chuck_joke)\r\n\r\n# chuck_joke\r\n(T-303-HUGB, Hugbúnaðarfræði, 2015-3)\r\n\r\nSample program used to show students Gradle in action. Based on [Jón Ingi's Hello World Gradle app](https://github.com/joningis/hugb_hello_world).\r\n\r\n## Project content\r\n- **build.gradle** (The gradle build file that we use)\r\n- **gradle** (Folder containing the gradle wrapper)\r\n- **gradlew** (Linux/Unix script to run the gradle wrapper)\r\n- **gradlew.bat** (Windows script to run the gradle wrapper)\r\n- **settings.gradle** (Settings file for gradle, not used in our example, can for example contain definitions if we have multiple projects)\r\n- **src** (Source folder for our code)\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n1. Fork this repo to your own account (or organization's account).\r\n2. Clone this repo to your computer\r\n    * Using https: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB/chuck_joke.git`\r\n    * Or, better yet, using ssh: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB/chuck_joke.git`\r\n3. Make sure it runs on your setup: `./gradlew check` or `gradlew.bat check` if you are running on Windows.\r\n4. If everything is OK, you can use the scripts in the `bin/` folder to compile, package, run or deploy.\r\n5. To make the server run on a different port, other than 4567, you'll need to do `export PORT=1337` (for port 1337 on \\*nix computers) or `set PORT=1337` on Windows.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
